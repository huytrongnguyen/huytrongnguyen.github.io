# MATH 098 Intermediate Algebra

## Pre-Algebra

### Pre-Algebra - Integers

Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative Numbers.
The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multi- plying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero, and their opposites (negatives).

### Pre-Algebra - Fractions

Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions.
Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will briefly review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions.

World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt around 2000 BC!

We always like our final answers when working with fractions to be reduced. Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numerator and denomi- nator by the same number.

The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators together.

Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing fractions requires us to first take the reciprocal of the second fraction and mul- tiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous problem.

To add and subtract fractions we will first have to find the least common denomi- nator (LCD). There are several ways to find an LCD. One way is to find the smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can also divide the small denomiator by.

Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. If both fractions already have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator.

If the denominators do not match we will first have to identify the LCD and build up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denominators by the same number so the denominator is built up to the LCD.

### Pre-Algebra - Order of Operations

Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including the use of absolute value.
When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct order.
Order of Operations (PEMDAS):
* Parenthesis (Grouping)
* Exponents
* Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)
* Add and Subtract (Left to Right)

### Pre-Algebra - Properties of Algebra

Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values, distributing, and combining like terms
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.

World View Note: The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr which means “reunion”. It was first used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn- Musa al-Khwarizmi.

The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using order of operations.

It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents included). Examples of like terms would be 3xy and − 7xy or 3a2b and 8a2b or − 3 and 5. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in front of the variables, then keep the variables the same.

A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with prob- lems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis by each term inside of the parenthesis.

Distributive Property: a(b + c) = ab + ac

## Solving Linear Equations

### Solving Linear Equations - One Step Equations

Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing using inverse operations
Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek to find.

4x+16=−4

### Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations

Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse opperations.
After mastering the technique for solving equations that are simple one-step equa- tions, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equa- tions, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards! When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a “plus five” in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson).

4x−20=−8

World View Note: Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam would solve algebraic problems geometrically by intersecting graphs rather than solving them algebraically.

### Solving Linear Equations - General Equations

Objective: Solve general linear equations with variables on both sides.
Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipu- lating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pat- tern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distributive property.

4(2x−6)+9=3(x−7)+8x

There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving these linear equa- tions.
If the variables subtract out completely and we are left with a true statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what x is. Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers or R.
However, this time we are left with a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what x is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or ∅.

### Solving Linear Equations - Fractions

Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coefficients by multi- plying by the least common denominator to clear the fractions.
Often when solving linear equations we will need to work with an equation with fraction coefficients.

### Solving Linear Equations - Formulas

Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.
Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only difference is we will have several varaibles in the problem and we will be attempting to solve for one specific variable. For example, we may have a formula such as A = πr2 + πrs (formula for surface area of a  right circular cone) and we may be interested in solving for the varaible s. This means we want to isolate the s so the equation has s on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like s = A−πr2. This second equation gives the same information as the first, they are πs
algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the area, while the other is solved for s (slant height of the cone).

When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the one varaible we are trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numbers.

It is important to note that we know we are done with the problem when the variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation.

World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blancing by subtracting the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr which later became the world algebra.

### Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value

Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute value can be either nega- tive or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations.

### Solving Linear Equations - Variation

Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and finding the variation constant.
One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a k, describes the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change. There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the second method.
The greek letter pi (π) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi cal- culated the value of π to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most accurate value of π for the next 1000 years!

If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you have a bigger circum- ference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to divide to find the constant of variation.

In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.

The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, 12 . This relationship is called joint variation or jointly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to divide the first variable by the product of the other two to find the constant of variation.

Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to find other combina- tions in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three important steps, none of which should be skipped.
1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation
2. Find the constant of variation using known values
3. Answer the question using the constant of variation

### Linear Equations - Number and Geometry

Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating and solving a linear equation.
Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.
A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set up a problem.
• A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable
• Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals (=)
x is 5 becomes x=5
• More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards,
writing the second part plus the first Three more than a number becomes x + 3
• Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as well, writing the second part minus the first
Four less than a number becomes x − 4
Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve.

### Solving Linear Equations - Age Problems

Objective: Solve age problems by creating and solving a linear equa- tion.
An application of linear equations is what are called age problems. When we are solving age problems we generally will be comparing the age of two people both now and in the future (or past). Using the clues given in the problem we will be working to find their current age. There can be a lot of information in these prob- lems and we can easily get lost in all the information. To help us organize and solve our problem we will fill out a three by three table for each problem.

### Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time

Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear equation.
An application of linear equations can be found in distance problems. When solving distance problems we will use the relationship r t = d or rate (speed) times time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours. To find the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120. This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we will be solving here will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the information in the problem organized we will use a table.

## Graphing

### Graphing - Points and Lines

Objective: Graph points and lines using xy coordinates.
Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solu- tions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representa- tion of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.
The plane is divided into four sections by a horizontal number line (x-axis) and a vertical number line (y-axis).
We can put dots on the graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that defines its loca- tion. The first number will be the value on the x − axis or horizontal number line. This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second number will represent the value on the y − axis or vertical number line. This is the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an ordered pair (x, y).

### Graphing - Slope

Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.
As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A line with a small slope, such as 1/10 is very flat. We will also use slope to describe the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.

As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction rise/run.
Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the y-values. Run would be a hor- izontal change, or a change in the x-values. So another way to describe slope would be the fraction change in x/change in y. It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to make what is called a slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope.

To find the slope of this line we will consider the rise, or verticle change and the run or horizontal change. Drawing these lines in makes a slope triangle that we can use to count from one point to the next the graph goes down 4, right 6. This is rise − 4, run 6. As a fraction it would be, −4/6. Reduce the fraction to get − 2/3 .

World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line!

There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.

As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.

We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in y values, we can calculate this by subtracting the y values of a point. Similarly, if run is a change in the x values, we can calculate this by subtracting the x values of a point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.

The slope of a line through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 − y1) / (x2 − x1)

When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope. For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable m. Now we have the following for slope.

Slope = m = rise / run = change in y / change in = (y2 − y1) / (x2 − x1)

As we subtract the y values and the x values when calculating slope it is impor- tant we subtract them in the same order.

Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.

Using the slope formula we can also find missing points if we know what the slope is.

### Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form

Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-inter- cept.
When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the y- intercept, where it crosses the axis and x = 0, can be represented by (0, b) where b is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope formula and solve the formula for y.

Slope − Intercept Equation: y = m x + b

### Graphing - Point-Slope Form

Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and point.
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use, however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-intercept in order to use it! Generally we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases we can’t use the slope inter- cept equation, so we will use a different more flexible formula. If we let the slope of an equation be m, and a specific point on the line be (x1, y1), and any other point on the line be (x, y). We can use the slope formula to make a second equa- tion.

Point − Slope Formula: y − y1 = m(x − x1)

World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a river that flowed through the city breaking it into several parts. There were 7 bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhard Euler considered the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and only once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foun- dation of what would become graph theory.

### Graphing - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

Objective: Identify the equation of a line given a parallel or perpendicular line.
There is an interesting connection between the slope of lines that are parallel and the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right angle).

As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendic- ular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) reciprocal (flipped fraction) slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions about parallel and per- pendicular lines.

Once we have a slope, it is possible to find the complete equation of the second line if we know one point on the second line.

Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a horizontal line, one is a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicular to a vertical line we can say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular slopes!

## Inequalities

### Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to linear inequalities.
When we have an equation such as x = 4 we have a specific value for our variable. With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:
> Greater than
􏰔>= Greater than or equal to
< Less than
􏰓<= Less than or equal to

If we have an expression such as x < 4, this means our variable can be any number smaller than 4 such as − 2, 0, 3, 3.9 or even 3.999999999 as long as it is smaller than 4. If we have an expression such as x 􏰔 − 2, this means our variable can be any number greater than or equal to − 2, such as 5, 0, − 1, − 1.9999, or even − 2.

Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the vari- able is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either ) or ( for less than or greater than respectively, and ] or [ for less than or equal to or greater than or equal to respectively.

Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use ∞ (infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use − ∞ negative infinity. If we use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that value.

Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we will have to first solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.

As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number, the symbol will need to flip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve inequalities.

The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change the symbol!)

It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the previous example (4 < x rather than x > 4). Often students draw their graphs the wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable, this means the variable is greater than 4. So we must shade above the 4.

### Inequalities - Compound Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of compound inequalities.
Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investi- gate in this lesson.

The first type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them together.

When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two different parts to the graph we will put a ∪ (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation, one for each part.

There are several different results that could result from an OR statement. The graphs could be pointing different directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite direc- tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval notation works for each of these cases.

The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, first graph both inequali- ties above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn onto the number line for our final graph. When our solution is given in interval notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - ∩ , but we will not use it here).

Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual graphs makes it to the final number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are also three different types of results we could get. The first is shown in the above example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is expressed in each case.

In this graph there is no overlap of the parts. Because their is no overlap, no values make it to the final number line.
Interval Notation: No Solution or ∅

The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as 5 < x 􏰓 8, to show x is between 5 and 8 (or equal to 8). When solving these type of inequalities, because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appro- priate brackets on the ends.

### Inequalities - Absolute Value Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to inequalities with absolute values.
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.

Consider |x| < 2.
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is less than 2. So on a number line we will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero.

This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities! When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the leftandthepositivevalueontheright. So|x|<2becomes−2<x<2,asthe graph above illustrates.

Consider |x| > 2.
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than 2. So on the number line we shade all points that are more than 2 units away from zero.

This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to an OR inequality, the first inequality looking just like the problem with no absolute value, the second flipping the inequality symbol and changing the value to a negative. So |x|>2becomesx>2orx<−2, as the graph above illustrates.

For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequali- ties.

We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa- tions. Our first step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if we multiply or divide by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!

It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be posi- tive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a nega- tive, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.

## Systems of Equations

### Systems of Equations - Graphing

Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and identifying the point of intersection.
We have solved problems like 3x − 4 = 11 by adding 4 to both sides and then dividing by 3 (solution is x = 5). We also have methods to solve equations with more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for more than one vari- able we will need the same number of equations as variables. For example, to solve for two variables such as x and y we will need two equations. When we have several equations we are using to solve, we call the equations a system of equa- tions. When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solution that works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair (x, y).

It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both equations. In this lesson we will be working to find this point given the equations. It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the solution, we can use graphs to find the solutions.

If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can graph two lines on the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equations. We are interested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this would be where the lines intersect! If we can find the intersection of the lines we have found the solution that works in both equations.

Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we will have to solve both equations for y first so we can idenfity the slope and y-intercept.

If the lines do not inter- sect we know that there is no point that works in both equations, there is no solution.

We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known there was no solu- tion even without having to graph the lines.

As one line is directly on top of the other line, we can say that the lines “inter- sect” at all the points! Here we say we have infinite solutions

Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could have noticed that the equations were the same. At this point we could have stated that there are infinite solutions without having to go through the work of graphing the equa- tions.

World View Note: The Babylonians were the first to work with systems of equations with two variables. However, their work with systems was quickly passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations with three or four variables and around 300 AD, developed methods for solving systems with any number of unknowns!

### Systems of Equations - Substitution

Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.
When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. First, it requires the graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we may arrive at the wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is really large, over 100 for example, or if the answer is a decimal the that graph will not help us find, 3.2134 for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used.
The first algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of substitution through several example, then end with a five-step process to solve problems using this method.

When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (or expression) in for the variable in the other equation. It is very important that when we substi- tute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis.

By using the entire expression 3x − 7 to replace y in the other equation we were able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for our first variable. However, the lone variable (a variable without a coefficient) is not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens we can isolate it by solving for the lone variable.

The process in the previous example is how we will solve problems using substitu-tion. This process is described and illustrated in the following table which lists the five steps to solving by substitution.

1. Find the lone variable
2. Solve for the lone variable
3. Substitute into the untouched equation
4. Solve
5. Plug into lone variable equation and evaluate

Sometimes we have several lone variables in a problem. In this case we will have the choice on which lone variable we wish to solve for, either will give the same final result.

Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution ∅ (parallel lines) or infinite solutions (same line) with the substitution method.

Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know that anything that works in the first equation, will also work in the second equation. However, we do not always end up with a true statement.

Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know that nothing will work in both equations.

One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no lone variable? If there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solve, we will just have to select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve.

Using the fractions does make the problem a bit more tricky. This is why we have another method for solving systems of equations that will be discussed in another lesson.

### Systems of Equations - Addition/Elimination

Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition/elimination method.
When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limited when solving equations. We then considered a second method known as substituion. This is probably the most used idea in solving systems in various areas of algebra. How- ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variable. This leads us to our second method for solving systems of equations. This method is known as either Elimination or Addition.

In the previous example one variable had opposites in front of it, − 4y and 4y. Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This allowed us to solve for the x. This is the idea behind the addition method. However, generally we won’t have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case we will manipulate the equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or both equations (on both sides!).

When we looked at the x terms, − 6x and 2x we decided to multiply the 2x by 3 to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking for with our oppo- sites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coefficients. We also could have solved the above problem by looking at the terms with y, 5y and 3y. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. So we would want to multiply both equations, the 5y by 3, and the 3y by − 5 to get opposites, 15y and − 15y. This illustrates an important point, some problems we will have to multiply both equations by a constant (on both sides) to get the opposites we want.

It is important for each problem as we get started that all variables and constants are lined up before we start multiplying and adding equations. This is illustrated in the next example which includes the five steps we will go through to solve a problem using elimination.

1. Line up the variables and constants
2. Multiply to get opposites (use LCD)
3. Add
4. Solve
5. Plug into either original and solve

Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have no solution or infinite solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if the variables all disappear from our problem, a true statment will indicate infinite solutions and a false stat- ment will indicate no solution.

We have covered three different methods that can be used to solve a system of two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. Substitution works great when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when the other two methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is important you are familiar with all three methods.

### Systems of Equations - Three Variables

Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi- tion/elimination.
Solving systems of equations with 3 variables is very similar to how we solve sys- tems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usually by addition), which we can then solve by either addition or substitution.

To reduce from three variables down to two it is very important to keep the work organized. We will use addition with two equations to eliminate one variable. This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a different pair of equations and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equations (A) and (B) with the same two variables that we can solve using either method.

As we are solving for x, y, and z we will have an ordered triplet (x, y, z) instead of just the ordered pair (x, y). In this above problem, y was easily eliminated using the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bit of work to get a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equations, we may have to multiply equations by something on both sides to get the opposites we want so a variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant to eliminate the same variable both times using two different pairs of equations.

Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more difficult than two vari- ables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same variable twice using two different pairs of equations. It is possible to solve each system several different ways. We can use different pairs of equations or eliminate variables in different orders, but as long as our information is organized and our algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same final solution.

### Systems of Equations - Value Problems

One application of system of equations are known as value problems. Value prob- lems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. For example, if our variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a value of five cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value problems.

The first column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have 7 dimes, each with a value of 10 cents, the total value is 7 · 10 = 70 cents. The last row of the table is for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it. Once the table is filled in we can easily make equations by adding each column, setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column.

World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not 10 cents). On the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not 25 cents). On the penny it says “one cent” (not 1 cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily use the coins.

Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to multiply one variable by 2, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by 2. Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the equation would be d=2n.

### Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems

Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final solution.

The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal) in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem and answer the questions.
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one vari- able problems.

## Polynomials

### Polynomials - Exponent Properties

Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.

World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)

Product Rule of Exponents: a<sup>m</sup> * a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m+n</sup>
Quotient Rule of Exponents: a<sup>m</sup> / a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m-n</sup>
Power of a Power Rule of Exponents: (a<sup>m</sup>)<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>mn</sup>
Power of a Product Rule of Exponents (ab)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>m</sup> * b<sup>m</sup>
Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents: (a / b)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>m</sup> / b<sup>m</sup>

### Polynomials - Negative Exponents

Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the properties of exponents.
There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not positive.

Zero Power Rule of Exponents: a<sup>0</sup> = 1
Rules of Negative Exponets: a<sup>-m</sup> = 1 / a<sup>m</sup>

Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denomi- nator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves, the exponent is now positive.

Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numer- ator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives.

### Polynomials - Scientific Notation

Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientific notation and exponent properties.
One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles. An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties make this process much simpler.

First we will take a look at what scientific notation is. Scientific notation has two parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.

Scientific Notation: a × 10<sup>b</sup> where 1 􏰓 a < 10

The exponent, b, is very important to how we convert between scientific notation and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many times we will multiply by 10. Multiplying by 10 in affect moves the decimal point one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive expo- nents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and neg- ative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than one).

Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation and scientific notation.

Converting between standard notation and scientific notation is important to understand how scientific notation works and what it does. Here our main interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation using exponent properties. The way we do this is first do the operation with the front number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the 10’s. Scientific notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative expo- nents in our final solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are dealing with small numbers.

Often when we multiply or divide in scientific notation the end result is not in sci- entific notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientific notation and then combine the 10’s using the product property of exponents and adding the exponents.

World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician, developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to scientific notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it would take to fill the universe. His conclusion was 1063 grains of sand because he figured the universe to have a diameter of 1014 stadia or about 2 light years.

### Polynomials - Introduction to Polynomials

Objective: Evaluate, add, and subtract polynomials.
Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are called polynomials. Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or vari- ables. For example, 5x, 2y2, − 5, ab3c, and x are all terms. Terms are connected to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are often named based on the number of terms in them. A monomial has one term, such as 3x2. A bino- mial has two terms, such as a2 − b2. A Trinomial has three terms, such as ax2 + bx + c. The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trino- mials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polyno- mials”.
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the vari- able with the number and evaluate the polynomial

It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember the exponent only effects the number it is physically attached to. This means − 32 = − 9 because the exponent is only attached to the 3. Also, ( − 3)2 = 9 because the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and effects everything inside. When we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous example, the substi- tuted value is in parenthesis.

World View Note: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Difference Engine that would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work became the founda- tion for what would become the modern computer (the programming language Ada was named in her honor), more than 100 years after her death from cancer.

Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the vari- able, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combining like terms.

### Polynomials - Multiplying Polynomials

Objective: Multiply polynomials.
Multiplying polynomials can take several different forms based on what we are multiplying. We will first look at multiplying monomials, then monomials by polynomials and finish with polynomials by polynomials.
Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coefficients and then adding the exponents on like factors.

There are several different methods for multiplying polynomials. All of which work, often students prefer the method they are first taught. Here three methods will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multipli- cation problems.

Multiply by Distributing
Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can distribute an entire polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polynomial and put it in front of the first polynomial.

Multiply by FOIL
Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL method we mul- tiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. The letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we mul- tiply the first term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we multiply the outside two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two terms. L stands for Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial.

Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributing the first term 4x through the (3x − 2y) and distributing the second term 7y through the (3x − 2y). Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend this method to problems with more terms.

The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for example, consider the previous example, a student will often go from the problem (4x + 7y)(3x − 2y) and do the multiplication mentally to come up with 12x2 − 8xy + 21xy − 14y2 and then combine like terms to come up with the final solution.

Multiplying in rows
A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very similar to multiplying numbers.

This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplying a monomial by a polynomial!
Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomials. It is suggested that you are very comfortable with at least one of these methods as you work through the practice problems.


### Polynomials - Multiply Special Products

Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum and differ- ence and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.
There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying polynomials. If we can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the solution much quicker. These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algebra continues.
The first shortcut is often called a sum and a difference. A sum and a differ- ence is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are exactly the same, but the sign in the middle is different (one sum, one difference).

(a+b)(a−b) = a2−b2

The important part of this example is the middle terms subtracted to zero. Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a difference we will jump right to our solution by squaring the first term and squaring the last term, putting a subtraction between them.

This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplying and combining like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out using another method and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be very useful when we get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplication process.

Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square. These are easy to recognize as we will have a binomial with a 2 in the exponent.

(a+b)2 = a2 +2ab+b2

This problem also helps us find our shortcut for multiplying. The first term in the answer is the square of the first term in the problem. The middle term is 2 times the first term times the second term. The last term is the square of the last term. This can be shortened to square the first, twice the product, square the last. If we can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial.

Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the following: (x − 5)2 = x2 − 25 (or x2 + 25). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, − 10x. This is why it is important to use the shortcut to help us find the correct solution. Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has the same sign as the middle term in the problem.

These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in reverse, will be. The final example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one negative), be sure to notice the difference between the examples and how each for- mula is used

World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as well, such as (a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3. While French mathematician Blaise Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions of binomials in the 17th century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost 400 years earlier!

### Polynomials - Divide Polynomials

Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.
Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long division of whole numbers. But before we look at that, we will first want to be able to master dividing a polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing, but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing each term by the mono- mial and reducing the resulting expression.

This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The only difference is we will replace the word “number” with the word “term”

Dividing Polynomials
1. Divide front terms
2. Multiply this term by the divisor
3. Change the sign of the terms and combine
4. Bring down the next term
5. Repeat

Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not changing the signs of the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracting on long division with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step!

In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponents on our variable counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second power, first power, zero power (remember x0 = 1 so there is no variable on zero power). This is very important in long division, the variables must count down and no exponent can be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero for its coefficient.

It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verify that the exponents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the problem. Also, this final example illustrates, just as in regular long division, sometimes we have no remainder in a problem.

World View Note: Paolo Ruffini was an Italian Mathematician of the early 19th century. In 1809 he was the first to describe a process called synthetic divi- sion which could also be used to divide polynomials.

## Factoring

### Factoring - Greatest Common Factor

Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial and factor it out of the expression.
The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factoring polynomials. There are many benifits of a polynomial being factored. We use factored polynomials to help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work with fractions and more. Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polyno- mials it is very important to have very strong factoring skills.

In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest common factor or GCF of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multiplied monomials by polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as 4x2(2x2 − 3x + 8) = 8x4 − 12x3 + 32x. In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We will start with 8x2 − 12x3 + 32x and try and work backwards to the 4x2(2x − 3x + 8).

To do this we have to be able to first identify what is the GCF of a polynomial. We will first introduce this by looking at finding the GCF of several numbers. To find a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest number that can be divided by each of the numbers.

When there are variables in our problem we can first find the GCF of the numbers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each term, using the lowest exponent.

To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we first need to identify the GCF of all the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthesis, then we divide each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the parenthesis.

With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiplying (distributing in this case) out the answer and the solution should be the original equation.

It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was 7x and 7x was one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of 1. Students often try to factor out the 7x and get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make terms dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1, be sure to not forget to put the 1 into the solution.
Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis

Again, in the previous problem, when dividing 9a2b3 by itself, the answer is 1, not zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your final solution.

### Factoring - Grouping

Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using grouping.
The first thing we will always do when factoring is try to factor out a GCF. This GCF is often a monomial like in the problem 5xy + 10xz the GCF is the mono- mial 5x, so we would have 5x(y + 2z). However, a GCF does not have to be a monomial, it could be a binomial.

In the same way we factored out a GCF of x we can factor out a GCF which is a binomial, (2a + 5b). This process can be extended to factor problems where there is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to factor. We will use a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplying in reverse, so first we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to reverse the process.

(2a + 3)(5b + 2) = 10ab + 15b + 4a + 6

The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution by looking at the two parts, 5b(2a + 3) and 2(2a + 3). When we are factoring by grouping we will always divide the problem into two parts, the first two terms and the last two terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match on both the left and right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, putting the rest in parenthesis and we will be factored.

The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any difference between the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be factored using the grouping method.

Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite of the GCF when factoring. If the first term of the first binomial is positive in the problem, we will also want the first term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match.

Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of 1 or − 1. Often this is all we need to be sure the two binomials match.

Another problem that may come up with grouping is after factoring out the GCF on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than just the signs are dif- ferent. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightly. One way to do this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do this we will move the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps us use grouping.

When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two ways that this can happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happens with addition, for example the binomials are (a + b) and (b + a), we don’t have to do any extra work. This is because addition is the same in either order (5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8).

However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful. For example, if the binomials are (a − b) and (b − a), we will factor out the oppo- site of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what happens when we factor out − 1.

World View Note: Sofia Kovalevskaya of Russia was the first woman on the editorial staff of a mathematical journal in the late 19th century. She also did research on how the rings of Saturn rotated.

### Factoring - Trinomials where a = 1

Objective: Factor trinomials where the coefficient of x2 is one.
Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most important type of factoring to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwards we will start with a multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the process.

The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middle term. Why did we pick+6x−4x and not +5x−3x? The reason is because 6x−4x is the only combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combination that works? To find the correct way to split the middle term we will use what is called the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is called the ac method. The way the ac method works is we find a pair of numers that multiply to a cer- tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to multiply to get the last term and add to get the coefficient of the middle term. In the previous example that would mean we wanted to multiply to − 24 and add to + 2. The only numbers that can do this are 6 and −4 (6·−4=−24and6+(−4)=2).

Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems solve just like prob- lems with one variable, using the coefficients to decide how to split the middle term

As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to be aware of negatives as we find the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle term.

You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems. Once we identify the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these are the two num- bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers used to split the middle term were 6 and − 1, our factors turned out to be (x + 6)(x − 1). This pattern does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of using it. We can use it however, when we have no number (technically we have a 1) in front of x2. In all the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no number in front of x2. If this is the case then we can use this shortcut.

World View Note: The first person to use letters for unknown values was Fran- cois Vieta in 1591 in France. He used vowels to represent variables we are solving for, just as codes used letters to represent an unknown message.

### Factoring - Trinomials where a != 1

Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the coefficient of x2 is not one.
When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the middle term and then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial equation, ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are the numbers in front of x2, x and the constant at the end respectively.

World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who first used let- ters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values we know (a, b, c) and letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and are solving for (x, y, z).

The ac method is named ac because we multiply a · c to find out what we want to multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to just c because there was no number in front of x2. This meant the number was 1 and we were multi- plying to 1c or just c. Now we will have a number in front of x2 so we will be looking for numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Other than this, the pro- cess will be the same.

### Factoring - Factoring Special Products

Objective: Identify and factor special products including a difference of squares, perfect squares, and sum and difference of cubes.
When factoring there are a few special products that, if we can recognize them, can help us factor polynomials. The first is one we have seen before. When multi- plying special products we found that a sum and a difference could multiply to a difference of squares. Here we will use this special product to help us factor

Difference of Squares: a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)

If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and difference of the square roots.

It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime.
Sum of Squares: a2 + b2 = Prime
A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factoring a difference
of 4th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a square (√a4 = a2), we can factor a difference of fourth powers just like we factor a difference of squares, to a sum and difference of the square roots. This will give us two factors, one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which will be a difference of squares which we can factor again.

Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a shortcut for multi- plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us factor a perfect square
Perfect Square: a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
A perfect square can be difficult to recognize at first glance, but if we use the ac method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square. Then we can just factor using the square roots of the first and last terms and the sign from the middle.

World View Note: The first known record of work with polynomials comes from the Chinese around 200 BC. Problems would be written as “three sheafs of a good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for 29 dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) 3x + 2y + z = 29.

Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can either do a sum or a difference of cubes. Both sum and difference of cubes have very similar factoring formulas

SumofCubes:a3 +b3 =(a+b)(a2 −ab+b2)
DifferenceofCubes:a3 −b3 =(a−b)(a2 +ab+b2)
