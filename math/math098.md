# MATH 098 Intermediate Algebra

## Pre-Algebra

### Pre-Algebra - Integers

Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative Numbers.
The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multi- plying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero, and their opposites (negatives).

### Pre-Algebra - Fractions

Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions.
Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will briefly review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions.

World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt around 2000 BC!

We always like our final answers when working with fractions to be reduced. Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numerator and denomi- nator by the same number.

The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators together.

Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing fractions requires us to first take the reciprocal of the second fraction and mul- tiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous problem.

To add and subtract fractions we will first have to find the least common denomi- nator (LCD). There are several ways to find an LCD. One way is to find the smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can also divide the small denomiator by.

Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. If both fractions already have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator.

If the denominators do not match we will first have to identify the LCD and build up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denominators by the same number so the denominator is built up to the LCD.

### Pre-Algebra - Order of Operations

Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including the use of absolute value.
When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct order.
Order of Operations (PEMDAS):
* Parenthesis (Grouping)
* Exponents
* Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)
* Add and Subtract (Left to Right)

### Pre-Algebra - Properties of Algebra

Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values, distributing, and combining like terms
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.

World View Note: The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr which means “reunion”. It was first used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn- Musa al-Khwarizmi.

The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using order of operations.

It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents included). Examples of like terms would be 3xy and − 7xy or 3a2b and 8a2b or − 3 and 5. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in front of the variables, then keep the variables the same.

A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with prob- lems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis by each term inside of the parenthesis.

Distributive Property: a(b + c) = ab + ac

## Solving Linear Equations

### Solving Linear Equations - One Step Equations

Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing using inverse operations
Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek to find.

4x+16=−4

### Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations

Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse opperations.
After mastering the technique for solving equations that are simple one-step equa- tions, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equa- tions, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards! When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a “plus five” in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson).

4x−20=−8

World View Note: Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam would solve algebraic problems geometrically by intersecting graphs rather than solving them algebraically.

### Solving Linear Equations - General Equations

Objective: Solve general linear equations with variables on both sides.
Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipu- lating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pat- tern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distributive property.

4(2x−6)+9=3(x−7)+8x

There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving these linear equa- tions.
If the variables subtract out completely and we are left with a true statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what x is. Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers or R.
However, this time we are left with a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what x is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or ∅.

### Solving Linear Equations - Fractions

Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coefficients by multi- plying by the least common denominator to clear the fractions.
Often when solving linear equations we will need to work with an equation with fraction coefficients.

### Solving Linear Equations - Formulas

Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.
Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only difference is we will have several varaibles in the problem and we will be attempting to solve for one specific variable. For example, we may have a formula such as A = πr2 + πrs (formula for surface area of a  right circular cone) and we may be interested in solving for the varaible s. This means we want to isolate the s so the equation has s on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like s = A−πr2. This second equation gives the same information as the first, they are πs
algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the area, while the other is solved for s (slant height of the cone).

When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the one varaible we are trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numbers.

It is important to note that we know we are done with the problem when the variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation.

World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blancing by subtracting the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr which later became the world algebra.

### Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value

Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute value can be either nega- tive or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations.

### Solving Linear Equations - Variation

Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and finding the variation constant.
One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a k, describes the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change. There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the second method.
The greek letter pi (π) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi cal- culated the value of π to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most accurate value of π for the next 1000 years!

If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you have a bigger circum- ference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to divide to find the constant of variation.

In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.

The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, 12 . This relationship is called joint variation or jointly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to divide the first variable by the product of the other two to find the constant of variation.

Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to find other combina- tions in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three important steps, none of which should be skipped.
1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation
2. Find the constant of variation using known values
3. Answer the question using the constant of variation

### Linear Equations - Number and Geometry

Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating and solving a linear equation.
Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.
A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set up a problem.
• A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable
• Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals (=)
x is 5 becomes x=5
• More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards,
writing the second part plus the first Three more than a number becomes x + 3
• Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as well, writing the second part minus the first
Four less than a number becomes x − 4
Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve.

### Solving Linear Equations - Age Problems

Objective: Solve age problems by creating and solving a linear equa- tion.
An application of linear equations is what are called age problems. When we are solving age problems we generally will be comparing the age of two people both now and in the future (or past). Using the clues given in the problem we will be working to find their current age. There can be a lot of information in these prob- lems and we can easily get lost in all the information. To help us organize and solve our problem we will fill out a three by three table for each problem.

### Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time

Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear equation.
An application of linear equations can be found in distance problems. When solving distance problems we will use the relationship r t = d or rate (speed) times time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours. To find the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120. This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we will be solving here will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the information in the problem organized we will use a table.

## Graphing

### Graphing - Points and Lines

Objective: Graph points and lines using xy coordinates.
Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solu- tions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representa- tion of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.
The plane is divided into four sections by a horizontal number line (x-axis) and a vertical number line (y-axis).
We can put dots on the graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that defines its loca- tion. The first number will be the value on the x − axis or horizontal number line. This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second number will represent the value on the y − axis or vertical number line. This is the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an ordered pair (x, y).

### Graphing - Slope

Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.
As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A line with a small slope, such as 1/10 is very flat. We will also use slope to describe the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.

As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction rise/run.
Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the y-values. Run would be a hor- izontal change, or a change in the x-values. So another way to describe slope would be the fraction change in x/change in y. It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to make what is called a slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope.

To find the slope of this line we will consider the rise, or verticle change and the run or horizontal change. Drawing these lines in makes a slope triangle that we can use to count from one point to the next the graph goes down 4, right 6. This is rise − 4, run 6. As a fraction it would be, −4/6. Reduce the fraction to get − 2/3 .

World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line!

There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.

As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.

We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in y values, we can calculate this by subtracting the y values of a point. Similarly, if run is a change in the x values, we can calculate this by subtracting the x values of a point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.

The slope of a line through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 − y1) / (x2 − x1)

When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope. For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable m. Now we have the following for slope.

Slope = m = rise / run = change in y / change in = (y2 − y1) / (x2 − x1)

As we subtract the y values and the x values when calculating slope it is impor- tant we subtract them in the same order.

Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.

Using the slope formula we can also find missing points if we know what the slope is.

### Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form

Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-inter- cept.
When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the y- intercept, where it crosses the axis and x = 0, can be represented by (0, b) where b is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope formula and solve the formula for y.

Slope − Intercept Equation: y = m x + b

### Graphing - Point-Slope Form

Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and point.
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use, however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-intercept in order to use it! Generally we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases we can’t use the slope inter- cept equation, so we will use a different more flexible formula. If we let the slope of an equation be m, and a specific point on the line be (x1, y1), and any other point on the line be (x, y). We can use the slope formula to make a second equa- tion.

Point − Slope Formula: y − y1 = m(x − x1)

World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a river that flowed through the city breaking it into several parts. There were 7 bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhard Euler considered the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and only once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foun- dation of what would become graph theory.

### Graphing - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

Objective: Identify the equation of a line given a parallel or perpendicular line.
There is an interesting connection between the slope of lines that are parallel and the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right angle).

As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendic- ular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) reciprocal (flipped fraction) slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions about parallel and per- pendicular lines.

Once we have a slope, it is possible to find the complete equation of the second line if we know one point on the second line.

Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a horizontal line, one is a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicular to a vertical line we can say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular slopes!

## Inequalities

### Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to linear inequalities.
When we have an equation such as x = 4 we have a specific value for our variable. With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:
> Greater than
􏰔>= Greater than or equal to
< Less than
􏰓<= Less than or equal to

If we have an expression such as x < 4, this means our variable can be any number smaller than 4 such as − 2, 0, 3, 3.9 or even 3.999999999 as long as it is smaller than 4. If we have an expression such as x 􏰔 − 2, this means our variable can be any number greater than or equal to − 2, such as 5, 0, − 1, − 1.9999, or even − 2.

Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the vari- able is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either ) or ( for less than or greater than respectively, and ] or [ for less than or equal to or greater than or equal to respectively.

Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use ∞ (infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use − ∞ negative infinity. If we use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that value.

Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we will have to first solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.

As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number, the symbol will need to flip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve inequalities.

The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change the symbol!)

It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the previous example (4 < x rather than x > 4). Often students draw their graphs the wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable, this means the variable is greater than 4. So we must shade above the 4.

### Inequalities - Compound Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of compound inequalities.
Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investi- gate in this lesson.

The first type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them together.

When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two different parts to the graph we will put a ∪ (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation, one for each part.

There are several different results that could result from an OR statement. The graphs could be pointing different directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite direc- tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval notation works for each of these cases.

The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, first graph both inequali- ties above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn onto the number line for our final graph. When our solution is given in interval notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - ∩ , but we will not use it here).

Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual graphs makes it to the final number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are also three different types of results we could get. The first is shown in the above example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is expressed in each case.

In this graph there is no overlap of the parts. Because their is no overlap, no values make it to the final number line.
Interval Notation: No Solution or ∅

The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as 5 < x 􏰓 8, to show x is between 5 and 8 (or equal to 8). When solving these type of inequalities, because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appro- priate brackets on the ends.

### Inequalities - Absolute Value Inequalities

Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to inequalities with absolute values.
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.

Consider |x| < 2.
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is less than 2. So on a number line we will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero.

This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities! When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the leftandthepositivevalueontheright. So|x|<2becomes−2<x<2,asthe graph above illustrates.

Consider |x| > 2.
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than 2. So on the number line we shade all points that are more than 2 units away from zero.

This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by changing the problem to an OR inequality, the first inequality looking just like the problem with no absolute value, the second flipping the inequality symbol and changing the value to a negative. So |x|>2becomesx>2orx<−2, as the graph above illustrates.

For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequali- ties.

We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa- tions. Our first step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if we multiply or divide by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!

It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be posi- tive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a nega- tive, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.

## Systems of Equations

### Systems of Equations - Graphing

Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and identifying the point of intersection.
We have solved problems like 3x − 4 = 11 by adding 4 to both sides and then dividing by 3 (solution is x = 5). We also have methods to solve equations with more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for more than one vari- able we will need the same number of equations as variables. For example, to solve for two variables such as x and y we will need two equations. When we have several equations we are using to solve, we call the equations a system of equa- tions. When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solution that works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair (x, y).

It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both equations. In this lesson we will be working to find this point given the equations. It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the solution, we can use graphs to find the solutions.

If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can graph two lines on the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equations. We are interested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this would be where the lines intersect! If we can find the intersection of the lines we have found the solution that works in both equations.

Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we will have to solve both equations for y first so we can idenfity the slope and y-intercept.

If the lines do not inter- sect we know that there is no point that works in both equations, there is no solution.

We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known there was no solu- tion even without having to graph the lines.

As one line is directly on top of the other line, we can say that the lines “inter- sect” at all the points! Here we say we have infinite solutions

Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could have noticed that the equations were the same. At this point we could have stated that there are infinite solutions without having to go through the work of graphing the equa- tions.

World View Note: The Babylonians were the first to work with systems of equations with two variables. However, their work with systems was quickly passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations with three or four variables and around 300 AD, developed methods for solving systems with any number of unknowns!

### Systems of Equations - Substitution

Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.
When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. First, it requires the graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we may arrive at the wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is really large, over 100 for example, or if the answer is a decimal the that graph will not help us find, 3.2134 for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used.
The first algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of substitution through several example, then end with a five-step process to solve problems using this method.

When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (or expression) in for the variable in the other equation. It is very important that when we substi- tute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis.

By using the entire expression 3x − 7 to replace y in the other equation we were able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for our first variable. However, the lone variable (a variable without a coefficient) is not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens we can isolate it by solving for the lone variable.

The process in the previous example is how we will solve problems using substitu-tion. This process is described and illustrated in the following table which lists the five steps to solving by substitution.

1. Find the lone variable
2. Solve for the lone variable
3. Substitute into the untouched equation
4. Solve
5. Plug into lone variable equation and evaluate

Sometimes we have several lone variables in a problem. In this case we will have the choice on which lone variable we wish to solve for, either will give the same final result.

Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution ∅ (parallel lines) or infinite solutions (same line) with the substitution method.

Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know that anything that works in the first equation, will also work in the second equation. However, we do not always end up with a true statement.

Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know that nothing will work in both equations.

One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no lone variable? If there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solve, we will just have to select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve.

Using the fractions does make the problem a bit more tricky. This is why we have another method for solving systems of equations that will be discussed in another lesson.

### Systems of Equations - Addition/Elimination

Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition/elimination method.
When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limited when solving equations. We then considered a second method known as substituion. This is probably the most used idea in solving systems in various areas of algebra. How- ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variable. This leads us to our second method for solving systems of equations. This method is known as either Elimination or Addition.

In the previous example one variable had opposites in front of it, − 4y and 4y. Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This allowed us to solve for the x. This is the idea behind the addition method. However, generally we won’t have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case we will manipulate the equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or both equations (on both sides!).

When we looked at the x terms, − 6x and 2x we decided to multiply the 2x by 3 to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking for with our oppo- sites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coefficients. We also could have solved the above problem by looking at the terms with y, 5y and 3y. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. So we would want to multiply both equations, the 5y by 3, and the 3y by − 5 to get opposites, 15y and − 15y. This illustrates an important point, some problems we will have to multiply both equations by a constant (on both sides) to get the opposites we want.

It is important for each problem as we get started that all variables and constants are lined up before we start multiplying and adding equations. This is illustrated in the next example which includes the five steps we will go through to solve a problem using elimination.

1. Line up the variables and constants
2. Multiply to get opposites (use LCD)
3. Add
4. Solve
5. Plug into either original and solve

Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have no solution or infinite solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if the variables all disappear from our problem, a true statment will indicate infinite solutions and a false stat- ment will indicate no solution.

We have covered three different methods that can be used to solve a system of two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. Substitution works great when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when the other two methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is important you are familiar with all three methods.

### Systems of Equations - Three Variables

Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi- tion/elimination.
Solving systems of equations with 3 variables is very similar to how we solve sys- tems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usually by addition), which we can then solve by either addition or substitution.

To reduce from three variables down to two it is very important to keep the work organized. We will use addition with two equations to eliminate one variable. This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a different pair of equations and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equations (A) and (B) with the same two variables that we can solve using either method.

As we are solving for x, y, and z we will have an ordered triplet (x, y, z) instead of just the ordered pair (x, y). In this above problem, y was easily eliminated using the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bit of work to get a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equations, we may have to multiply equations by something on both sides to get the opposites we want so a variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant to eliminate the same variable both times using two different pairs of equations.

Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more difficult than two vari- ables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same variable twice using two different pairs of equations. It is possible to solve each system several different ways. We can use different pairs of equations or eliminate variables in different orders, but as long as our information is organized and our algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same final solution.

### Systems of Equations - Value Problems

One application of system of equations are known as value problems. Value prob- lems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. For example, if our variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a value of five cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value problems.

The first column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have 7 dimes, each with a value of 10 cents, the total value is 7 · 10 = 70 cents. The last row of the table is for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it. Once the table is filled in we can easily make equations by adding each column, setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column.

World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not 10 cents). On the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not 25 cents). On the penny it says “one cent” (not 1 cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily use the coins.

Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to multiply one variable by 2, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by 2. Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the equation would be d=2n.

### Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems

Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final solution.

The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal) in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem and answer the questions.
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one vari- able problems.

## Polynomials

### Polynomials - Exponent Properties

Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.

World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)

Product Rule of Exponents: a<sup>m</sup> * a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m+n</sup>
Quotient Rule of Exponents: a<sup>m</sup> / a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m-n</sup>
Power of a Power Rule of Exponents: (a<sup>m</sup>)<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>mn</sup>
Power of a Product Rule of Exponents (ab)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>m</sup> * b<sup>m</sup>
Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents: (a / b)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>m</sup> / b<sup>m</sup>

### Polynomials - Negative Exponents

Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the properties of exponents.
There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not positive.

Zero Power Rule of Exponents: a<sup>0</sup> = 1
Rules of Negative Exponets: a<sup>-m</sup> = 1 / a<sup>m</sup>

Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denomi- nator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves, the exponent is now positive.

Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numer- ator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives.

### Polynomials - Scientific Notation

Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientific notation and exponent properties.
One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles. An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties make this process much simpler.

First we will take a look at what scientific notation is. Scientific notation has two parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.

Scientific Notation: a × 10<sup>b</sup> where 1 􏰓 a < 10

The exponent, b, is very important to how we convert between scientific notation and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many times we will multiply by 10. Multiplying by 10 in affect moves the decimal point one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive expo- nents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and neg- ative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than one).

Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation and scientific notation.

Converting between standard notation and scientific notation is important to understand how scientific notation works and what it does. Here our main interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation using exponent properties. The way we do this is first do the operation with the front number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the 10’s. Scientific notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative expo- nents in our final solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are dealing with small numbers.

Often when we multiply or divide in scientific notation the end result is not in sci- entific notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientific notation and then combine the 10’s using the product property of exponents and adding the exponents.

World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician, developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to scientific notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it would take to fill the universe. His conclusion was 1063 grains of sand because he figured the universe to have a diameter of 1014 stadia or about 2 light years.

### Polynomials - Introduction to Polynomials

Objective: Evaluate, add, and subtract polynomials.
Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are called polynomials. Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or vari- ables. For example, 5x, 2y2, − 5, ab3c, and x are all terms. Terms are connected to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are often named based on the number of terms in them. A monomial has one term, such as 3x2. A bino- mial has two terms, such as a2 − b2. A Trinomial has three terms, such as ax2 + bx + c. The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trino- mials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polyno- mials”.
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the vari- able with the number and evaluate the polynomial

It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember the exponent only effects the number it is physically attached to. This means − 32 = − 9 because the exponent is only attached to the 3. Also, ( − 3)2 = 9 because the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and effects everything inside. When we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous example, the substi- tuted value is in parenthesis.

World View Note: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Difference Engine that would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work became the founda- tion for what would become the modern computer (the programming language Ada was named in her honor), more than 100 years after her death from cancer.

Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the vari- able, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combining like terms.

### Polynomials - Multiplying Polynomials

Objective: Multiply polynomials.
Multiplying polynomials can take several different forms based on what we are multiplying. We will first look at multiplying monomials, then monomials by polynomials and finish with polynomials by polynomials.
Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coefficients and then adding the exponents on like factors.

There are several different methods for multiplying polynomials. All of which work, often students prefer the method they are first taught. Here three methods will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multipli- cation problems.

Multiply by Distributing
Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can distribute an entire polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polynomial and put it in front of the first polynomial.

Multiply by FOIL
Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL method we mul- tiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. The letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we mul- tiply the first term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we multiply the outside two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two terms. L stands for Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial.

Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributing the first term 4x through the (3x − 2y) and distributing the second term 7y through the (3x − 2y). Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend this method to problems with more terms.

The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for example, consider the previous example, a student will often go from the problem (4x + 7y)(3x − 2y) and do the multiplication mentally to come up with 12x2 − 8xy + 21xy − 14y2 and then combine like terms to come up with the final solution.

Multiplying in rows
A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very similar to multiplying numbers.

This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplying a monomial by a polynomial!
Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomials. It is suggested that you are very comfortable with at least one of these methods as you work through the practice problems.


### Polynomials - Multiply Special Products

Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum and differ- ence and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.
There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying polynomials. If we can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the solution much quicker. These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algebra continues.
The first shortcut is often called a sum and a difference. A sum and a differ- ence is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are exactly the same, but the sign in the middle is different (one sum, one difference).

(a+b)(a−b) = a2−b2

The important part of this example is the middle terms subtracted to zero. Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a difference we will jump right to our solution by squaring the first term and squaring the last term, putting a subtraction between them.

This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplying and combining like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out using another method and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be very useful when we get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplication process.

Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square. These are easy to recognize as we will have a binomial with a 2 in the exponent.

(a+b)2 = a2 +2ab+b2

This problem also helps us find our shortcut for multiplying. The first term in the answer is the square of the first term in the problem. The middle term is 2 times the first term times the second term. The last term is the square of the last term. This can be shortened to square the first, twice the product, square the last. If we can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial.

Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the following: (x − 5)2 = x2 − 25 (or x2 + 25). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, − 10x. This is why it is important to use the shortcut to help us find the correct solution. Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has the same sign as the middle term in the problem.

These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in reverse, will be. The final example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one negative), be sure to notice the difference between the examples and how each for- mula is used

World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as well, such as (a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3. While French mathematician Blaise Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions of binomials in the 17th century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost 400 years earlier!

### Polynomials - Divide Polynomials

Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.
Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long division of whole numbers. But before we look at that, we will first want to be able to master dividing a polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing, but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing each term by the mono- mial and reducing the resulting expression.

This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The only difference is we will replace the word “number” with the word “term”

Dividing Polynomials
1. Divide front terms
2. Multiply this term by the divisor
3. Change the sign of the terms and combine
4. Bring down the next term
5. Repeat

Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not changing the signs of the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracting on long division with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step!

In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponents on our variable counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second power, first power, zero power (remember x0 = 1 so there is no variable on zero power). This is very important in long division, the variables must count down and no exponent can be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero for its coefficient.

It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verify that the exponents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the problem. Also, this final example illustrates, just as in regular long division, sometimes we have no remainder in a problem.

World View Note: Paolo Ruffini was an Italian Mathematician of the early 19th century. In 1809 he was the first to describe a process called synthetic divi- sion which could also be used to divide polynomials.

## Factoring

### Factoring - Greatest Common Factor

Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial and factor it out of the expression.
The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factoring polynomials. There are many benifits of a polynomial being factored. We use factored polynomials to help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work with fractions and more. Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polyno- mials it is very important to have very strong factoring skills.

In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest common factor or GCF of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multiplied monomials by polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as 4x2(2x2 − 3x + 8) = 8x4 − 12x3 + 32x. In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We will start with 8x2 − 12x3 + 32x and try and work backwards to the 4x2(2x − 3x + 8).

To do this we have to be able to first identify what is the GCF of a polynomial. We will first introduce this by looking at finding the GCF of several numbers. To find a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest number that can be divided by each of the numbers.

When there are variables in our problem we can first find the GCF of the numbers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each term, using the lowest exponent.

To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we first need to identify the GCF of all the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthesis, then we divide each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the parenthesis.

With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiplying (distributing in this case) out the answer and the solution should be the original equation.

It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was 7x and 7x was one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of 1. Students often try to factor out the 7x and get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make terms dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1, be sure to not forget to put the 1 into the solution.
Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis

Again, in the previous problem, when dividing 9a2b3 by itself, the answer is 1, not zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your final solution.

### Factoring - Grouping

Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using grouping.
The first thing we will always do when factoring is try to factor out a GCF. This GCF is often a monomial like in the problem 5xy + 10xz the GCF is the mono- mial 5x, so we would have 5x(y + 2z). However, a GCF does not have to be a monomial, it could be a binomial.

In the same way we factored out a GCF of x we can factor out a GCF which is a binomial, (2a + 5b). This process can be extended to factor problems where there is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to factor. We will use a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplying in reverse, so first we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to reverse the process.

(2a + 3)(5b + 2) = 10ab + 15b + 4a + 6

The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution by looking at the two parts, 5b(2a + 3) and 2(2a + 3). When we are factoring by grouping we will always divide the problem into two parts, the first two terms and the last two terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match on both the left and right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, putting the rest in parenthesis and we will be factored.

The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any difference between the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be factored using the grouping method.

Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite of the GCF when factoring. If the first term of the first binomial is positive in the problem, we will also want the first term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match.

Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of 1 or − 1. Often this is all we need to be sure the two binomials match.

Another problem that may come up with grouping is after factoring out the GCF on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than just the signs are dif- ferent. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightly. One way to do this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do this we will move the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps us use grouping.

When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two ways that this can happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happens with addition, for example the binomials are (a + b) and (b + a), we don’t have to do any extra work. This is because addition is the same in either order (5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8).

However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful. For example, if the binomials are (a − b) and (b − a), we will factor out the oppo- site of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what happens when we factor out − 1.

World View Note: Sofia Kovalevskaya of Russia was the first woman on the editorial staff of a mathematical journal in the late 19th century. She also did research on how the rings of Saturn rotated.

### Factoring - Trinomials where a = 1

Objective: Factor trinomials where the coefficient of x2 is one.
Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most important type of factoring to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwards we will start with a multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the process.

The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middle term. Why did we pick+6x−4x and not +5x−3x? The reason is because 6x−4x is the only combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combination that works? To find the correct way to split the middle term we will use what is called the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is called the ac method. The way the ac method works is we find a pair of numers that multiply to a cer- tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to multiply to get the last term and add to get the coefficient of the middle term. In the previous example that would mean we wanted to multiply to − 24 and add to + 2. The only numbers that can do this are 6 and −4 (6·−4=−24and6+(−4)=2).

Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems solve just like prob- lems with one variable, using the coefficients to decide how to split the middle term

As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to be aware of negatives as we find the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle term.

You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems. Once we identify the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these are the two num- bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers used to split the middle term were 6 and − 1, our factors turned out to be (x + 6)(x − 1). This pattern does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of using it. We can use it however, when we have no number (technically we have a 1) in front of x2. In all the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no number in front of x2. If this is the case then we can use this shortcut.

World View Note: The first person to use letters for unknown values was Fran- cois Vieta in 1591 in France. He used vowels to represent variables we are solving for, just as codes used letters to represent an unknown message.

### Factoring - Trinomials where a != 1

Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the coefficient of x2 is not one.
When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the middle term and then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial equation, ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are the numbers in front of x2, x and the constant at the end respectively.

World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who first used let- ters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values we know (a, b, c) and letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and are solving for (x, y, z).

The ac method is named ac because we multiply a · c to find out what we want to multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to just c because there was no number in front of x2. This meant the number was 1 and we were multi- plying to 1c or just c. Now we will have a number in front of x2 so we will be looking for numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Other than this, the pro- cess will be the same.

### Factoring - Factoring Special Products

Objective: Identify and factor special products including a difference of squares, perfect squares, and sum and difference of cubes.
When factoring there are a few special products that, if we can recognize them, can help us factor polynomials. The first is one we have seen before. When multi- plying special products we found that a sum and a difference could multiply to a difference of squares. Here we will use this special product to help us factor

Difference of Squares: a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)

If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and difference of the square roots.

It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime.
Sum of Squares: a2 + b2 = Prime
A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factoring a difference
of 4th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a square (√a4 = a2), we can factor a difference of fourth powers just like we factor a difference of squares, to a sum and difference of the square roots. This will give us two factors, one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which will be a difference of squares which we can factor again.

Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a shortcut for multi- plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us factor a perfect square
Perfect Square: a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
A perfect square can be difficult to recognize at first glance, but if we use the ac method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square. Then we can just factor using the square roots of the first and last terms and the sign from the middle.

World View Note: The first known record of work with polynomials comes from the Chinese around 200 BC. Problems would be written as “three sheafs of a good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for 29 dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) 3x + 2y + z = 29.

Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can either do a sum or a difference of cubes. Both sum and difference of cubes have very similar factoring formulas

SumofCubes:a3 +b3 =(a+b)(a2 −ab+b2)
DifferenceofCubes:a3 −b3 =(a−b)(a2 +ab+b2)

### Factoring - Factoring Strategy

Objective: Idenfity and use the correct method to factor various poly- nomials.
With so many different tools used to factor, it is easy to get lost as to which tool to use when. Here we will attempt to organize all the different factoring types we have seen. A large part of deciding how to solve a problem is based on how many terms are in the problem. For all problem types we will always try to factor out the GCF first.

Factoring Strategy (GCF First!!!!!)

• 2 terms: sum or difference of squares or cubes: a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)
a2 + b2 = Prime
a3 +b3 =(a+b)(a2 −ab+b2)
a3 − b3 = (a − b)(a2 + ab + b2)
• 3 terms: ac method, watch for perfect square! a2 +2ab+b2 =(a+b)2 Multiply to ac and add to b
• 4 terms: grouping

### Factoring - Solve by Factoring

Objective: Solve quadratic equation by factoring and using the zero product rule.
When solving linear equations such as 2x − 5 = 21 we can solve for the variable directly by adding 5 and dividing by 2 to get 13. However, when we have x2 (or a higher power of x) we cannot just isolate the variable as we did with the linear equations. One method that we can use to solve for the varaible is known as the zero product rule

ZeroProductRule:If ab=0 then either a=0 or b=0

The zero product rule tells us that if two factors are multiplied together and the answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero.

For the zero product rule to work we must have factors to set equal to zero. This means if the problem is not already factored we will factor it first.

Another important part of the zero product rule is that before we factor, the equation must equal zero. If it does not, we must move terms around so it does equal zero.

A question often asked is if it is possible to get rid of the square on the variable by taking the square root of both sides. While it is possible, there are a few prop- erties of square roots that we have not covered yet and thus it is common to break a rule of roots that we are not aware of at this point. The short reason we want to avoid this for now is because taking a square root will only give us one of the two answers. When we talk about roots we will come back to problems like these and see how we can solve using square roots in a method called completing the square. For now, never take the square root of both sides!


## Rational Expressions

### Rational Expressions - Reduce Rational Expressions

Objective: Reduce rational expressions by dividing out common factors.
Rational expressions are expressions written as a quotient of polynomials.

As rational expressions are a special type of fraction, it is important to remember with fractions we cannot have zero in the denominator of a fraction. For this reason, rational expressions may have one more excluded values, or values that the variable cannot be or the expression would be undefined.

World View Note: The number zero was not widely accepted in mathematical thought around the world for many years. It was the Mayans of Central America who first used zero to aid in the use of their base 20 system as a place holder!

Rational expressions are easily evaluated by simply substituting the value for the variable and using order of operations.

### Rational Expressions - Multiply & Divide

Objective: Multiply and divide rational expressions.
Multiplying and dividing rational expressions is very similar to the process we use to multiply and divide fractions.

The process is identical for division with the extra first step of multiplying by the reciprocal. When multiplying with rational expressions we follow the same pro- cess, first divide out common factors, then multiply straight across.

World View Note: Indian mat􏰁hematician Aryabhata, in the 6th century, published a work which included the rational expression n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6 for the sum of the first n squares (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 )

### Rational Expressions - Least Common Denominators

Objective: Idenfity the least common denominator and build up denominators to match this common denominator.
As with fractions, the least common denominator or LCD is very important to working with rational expressions. The process we use to find the LCD is based on the process used to find the LCD of intergers.

When finding the LCD of several monomials we first find the LCD of the coeffi- cients, then use all variables and attach the highest exponent on each variable.

The same pattern can be used on polynomials that have more than one term. However, we must first factor each polynomial so we can identify all the factors to be used (attaching highest exponent if necessary).

### Rational Expressions - Add & Subtract

Objective: Add and subtract rational expressions with and without common denominators.
Adding and subtracting rational expressions is identical to adding and subtracting with integers. Recall that when adding with a common denominator we add the numerators and keep the denominator. This is the same process used with rational expressions. Remember to reduce, if possible, your final answer.

Subtraction with common denominator follows the same pattern, though the sub- traction can cause problems if we are not careful with it. To avoid sign errors we will first distribute the subtraction through the numerator. Then we can treat it like an addition problem. This process is the same as “add the opposite” we saw when subtracting with negatives.

World View Note: The Rhind papyrus of Egypt from 1650 BC gives some of the earliest known symbols for addition and subtraction, a pair of legs walking in the direction one reads for addition, and a pair of legs walking in the opposite direction for subtraction..

When we don’t have a common denominator we will have to find the least common denominator (LCD) and build up each fraction so the denominators match.

If our denominators have more than one term in them we will need to factor first to find the LCD. Then we build up each denominator using the factors that are missing on each fraction.

### Rational Expressions - Complex Fractions

Objective: Simplify complex fractions by multiplying each term by the least common denominator.
Complex fractions have fractions in either the numerator, or denominator, or usu- ally both. These fractions can be simplified in one of two ways. This will be illus- trated first with integers, then we will consider how the process can be expanded to include expressions with variables.

The first method uses order of operations to simplify the numerator and denomi- nator first, then divide the two resulting fractions by multiplying by the recip- rocal.

Generally we prefer a different method, to multiply the numerator and denomi- nator of the large fraction (in effect each term in the complex fraction) by the least common denominator (LCD). This will allow us to reduce and clear the small fractions.

World View Note: Sophie Germain is one of the most famous women in mathe- matics, many primes, which are important to finding an LCD, carry her name. Germain primes are prime numbers where one more than double the prime number is also prime, for example 3 is prime and so is 2·3+1=7 prime. The largest known Germain prime (at the time of printing) is 183027 · 2^265440 − 1 which has 79911 digits!

Some problems may require us to FOIL as we simplify. To avoid sign errors, if there is a binomial in the numerator, we will first distribute the negative through the numerator.

### Rational Expressions - Proportions

Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and use propor- tions to solve application problems
When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. This definition can be generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportions have an important property called the cross-product.

Cross Product: If a/b = c/d then ad = bc
The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no fractions that we can solve.

World View Note: The first clear definition of a proportion and the notation for a proportion came from the German Leibniz who wrote, “I write dy: x = dt: a; for dy is to x as dt is to a, is indeed the same as, dy divided by x is equal to dt divided by a. From this equation follow then all the rules of proportion.”

If the proportion has more than one term in either numerator or denominator, we will have to distribute while calculating the cross product.

As we solve proportions we may end up with a quadratic that we will have to solve. We can solve this quadratic in the same way we solved quadratics in the past, either factoring, completing the square or the quadratic formula. As with solving quadratics before, we will generally end up with two solutions.

Proportions are very useful in how they can be used in many different types of applications. We can use them to compare different quantities and make conclu- sions about how quantities are related. As we set up these problems it is impor- tant to remember to stay organized, if we are comparing dogs and cats, and the number of dogs is in the numerator of the first fraction, then the numerator of the second fraction should also refer to the dogs. This consistency of the numerator and denominator is essential in setting up our proportions.

### Rational Expressions - Solving Rational Equations

Objective: Solve rational equations by identifying and multiplying by the least common denominator.
When solving equations that are made up of rational expressions we will solve them using the same strategy we used to solve linear equations with fractions. When we solved problems like the next example, we cleared the fraction by multi- plying by the least common denominator (LCD)

World View Note: Maria Agnesi was the first women to publish a math text- book in 1748, it took her over 10 years to write! This textbook covered everything from arithmetic thorugh differential equations and was over 1,000 pages!

If we are subtracting a fraction in the problem, it may be easier to avoid a future sign error by first distributing the negative through the numerator.

### Rational Expressions - Dimensional Analysis

Objective: Use dimensional analysis to preform single unit, dual unit, square unit, and cubed unit conversions.
One application of rational expressions deals with converting units. When we con- vert units of measure we can do so by multiplying several fractions together in a process known as dimensional analysis. The trick will be to decide what fractions to multiply. When multiplying, if we multiply by 1, the value of the expression does not change. One written as a fraction can look like many different things as long as the numerator and denominator are identical in value. Notice the numer- ator and denominator are not identical in appearance, but rather identical in value.

The idea behind dimensional analysis is we will multiply by a fraction in such a way that the units we don’t want will divide out of the problem. We found out when multiplying rational expressions that if a variable appears in the numerator and denominator we can divide it out of the expression. It is the same with units.

To focus on the process of conversions, a conversion sheet has been included at the end of this lesson which includes several conversion factors for length, volume, mass and time in both English and Metric units.

The process of dimensional analysis can be used to convert other types of units as well. If we can identify relationships that represent the same value we can make them into a conversion factor.

## Radicals

### Radicals - Square Roots

Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.
Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A square root “un- squares” a number. For example, because 52 = 25 we say the square root of 25 is 5. The square root of 25 is written as √25.

World View Note: The radical sign, when first used was an R with a line through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foundation”. It wasn’t until the 1500s that our current symbol was first used in Germany (but even then it was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers!

The final example, √− 81 is currently undefined as negatives have no square root. This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answer will be positive. Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In another lesson we will define a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative square roots, but for now we will simply say they are undefined.

Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if we found √8 on our calculator, the answer would be 2.828427124746190097603377448419... and even this number is a rounded approximation of the square root. To be as accu- rate as possible, we will never use the calculator to find decimal approximations of square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radical form. We will do this using a property known as the product rule of radicals

Product Rule of Square Roots: √a · b = √a · √b

We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as √36·5 by spliting it into two roots, √36 · √5, and simplifying the first root, 6√5. The trick in this process is being able to translate a problem like √180 into √36·5. There are sev- eral ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of practice, the fastest method, is to find perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or number under the radical.

Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of
variables, we can divide the exponent by 2. For example, √x8 = x4, because we divide the exponent of 8 by 2. This follows from the power of a power rule of expoennts, (x4)2 = x8. When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when taking a square root we divide the exponent by 2.

### Radicals - Higher Roots

Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two.
While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots, etc. Fol- lowing is a definition of radicals.

m√ a = b if b^m = a

The small letter m inside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we are taking, or which power we are “un-doing”. For square roots the index is 2. As this is the most common root, the two is not usually written.

World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century.

We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its impor- tant not to forget to check the index on the root. √81 =9 but √4 81 =3. This is because 9^2 = 81 and 3^4 = 81. Another thing to watch out for is negatives under roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a negative number raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot take an even root of a negative number, this we will say is undefined. In a later section we will discuss how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply say they are unde- fined.

We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simplified square roots, using the product property of radicals.

Product Property of Radicals: m√a b = m√a · m√b

Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with squares. It is important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our way to the solution.

### Radicals - Adding Radicals

Objective: Add like radicals by first simplifying each radical.
Adding and subtracting radicals is very similar to adding and subtracting with variables.

Notice that when we combined the terms with √11 it was just like combining terms with x. When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine like radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coefficients in front of the radical, and the radical stays the same.

### Radicals - Multiply and Divide Radicals

Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product and quotient rules of radicals.
Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the radicals match. The prodcut rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as follows:

Product Rule of Radicals: a m√b · c m√d = ac m√bd

Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long as the index matches.

As we are multiplying we always look at our final solution to check if all the radi- cals are simplified and all like radicals or like terms have been combined.

Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, if we think about division as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coefficients outside the radicals and reduce the values inside the radicals to get our final solution.

Quotient Rule of Radicals: a m√ b / c m√d = a/c * m√􏰑 b/d

If there is a radical in the denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radicals in the denominator. We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same thing. The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator. The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to focus on the index. The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For example, if the index is 4, we will need 4 of each factor to clear the radical.

### Radicals - Rationalize Denominators

Objective: Rationalize the denominators of radical expressions.
It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction. When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing in order to clear the radical. In the lesson on dividing radicals we talked about how this was done with monomials. Here we will look at how this is done with binomials.

If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is essentially the same as with monomials. The only difference is we will have to dis- tribute in the numerator.

It is important to remember that when reducing the fraction we cannot reduce with just the 3 and 12 or just the 9 and 12. When we have addition or subtrac- tion in the numerator or denominator we must divide all terms by the same number.

### Radicals - Rational Exponents

Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponential notation and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties of exponents.

When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the exponent by the index. Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This idea is how we will define rational exponents.

Definition of Rational Exponents: a^(n/m) = (m√a)^n

The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on our radical, like- wise the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the exponent. We can use this property to change any radical expression into an exponential expression.

The ability to change between exponential expressions and radical expressions allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating before by changing to a radical.

The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expression into an expo- nential expression is we are now allowed to use all our exponent properties to sim- plify.

When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multiply the numera- tors together and denominators together.

It is important to remember that as we simplify with rational exponents we are using the exact same properties we used when simplifying integer exponents. The only difference is we need to follow our rules for fractions as well. It may be worth reviewing your notes on exponent properties to be sure your comfortable with using the properties.

### Radicals - Radicals of Mixed Index

Objective: Reduce the index on a radical and multiply or divide radi- cals of different index.
Knowing that a radical has the same properties as exponents (written as a ratio) allows us to manipulate radicals in new ways. One thing we are allowed to do is reduce, not just the radicand, but the index as well.

What we have done is reduced our index by dividing the index and all the expo- nents by the same number (2 in the previous example). If we notice a common factor in the index and all the exponnets on every factor we can reduce by dividing by that common factor.

We can use the same process when there are coefficients in the problem. We will first write the coefficient as an exponential expression so we can divide the exponet by the common factor as well.

We can use a very similar idea to also multiply radicals where the index does not match. First we will consider an example using rational exponents, then identify the pattern we can use.

To combine the radicals we need a common index (just like the common denomi- nator). We will get a common index by multiplying each index and exponent by an integer that will allow us to build up to that desired index.

Often after combining radicals of mixed index we will need to simplify the resulting radical.

Just as with reducing the index, we will rewrite coefficients as exponential expressions.

If there is a binomial in the radical then we need to keep that binomial together through the entire problem.

World View Note: Originally the radical was just a check mark with the rest of the radical expression in parenthesis. In 1637 Rene Descartes was the first to put a line over the entire radical expression.

The same process is used for dividing mixed index as with multiplying mixed index. The only difference is our final answer cannot have a radical over the denominator.

### Radicals - Complex Numbers

Objective: Add, subtract, multiply, rationalize, and simplify expres- sions using complex numbers.
World View Note: When mathematics was first used, the primary purpose was for counting. Thus they did not originally use negatives, zero, fractions or irra- tional numbers. However, the ancient Egyptians quickly developed the need for “a part” and so they made up a new type of number, the ratio or fraction. The Ancient Greeks did not believe in irrational numbers (people were killed for believing otherwise). The Mayans of Central America later made up the number zero when they found use for it as a placeholder. Ancient Chinese Mathematicians made up negative numbers when they found use for them.

In mathematics, when the current number system does not provide the tools to solve the problems the culture is working with, we tend to make up new ways for dealing with the problem that can solve the problem. Throughout history this has been the case with the need for a number that is nothing (0), smaller than zero (negatives), between integers (fractions), and between fractions (irrational num- bers). This is also the case for the square roots of negative numbers. To work with the square root of negative numbers mathematicians have defined what are called imaginary and complex numbers.

Definition of Imaginary Numbers: i^2 = − 1 (thus i = √− 1)

Examples of imaginary numbers include 3i, − 6i, 35i and 3i√5. A complex number is one that contains both a real and imaginary part, such as 2 + 5i.

With this definition, the square root of a negative number is no longer undefined. We now are allowed to do basic operations with the square root of negatives. First we will consider exponents on imaginary numbers. We will do this by manipulating our definition of i2 = − 1. If we multiply both sides of the definition by i, the equation becomes i3 = − i. Then if we multiply both sides of the equa- tion again by i, the equation becomes i4 =−i2 =−(−1)=1, or simply i4 =1. Multiplying again by i gives i5 = i. One more time gives i6 = i2 = − 1. And if this pattern continues we see a cycle forming, the exponents on i change we cycle through simplified answers of i, − 1, − i, 1. As there are 4 different possible answers in this cycle, if we divide the exponent by 4 and consider the remainder, we can simplify any exponent on i by learning just the following four values:

Cyclic Property of Powers of i

i^0 = 1
i=i
i^2 = − 1
i^3 = − i

When performing operations (add, subtract, multilpy, divide) we can handle i just like we handle any other variable. This means when adding and subtracting com- plex numbers we simply add or combine like terms.

It is important to notice what operation we are doing. Students often see the parenthesis and think that means FOIL. We only use FOIL to multiply. This problem is an addition problem so we simply add the terms, or combine like terms.

For subtraction problems the idea is the same, we need to remember to first dis- tribute the negative onto all the terms in the parentheses.

Multiplying with complex numbers is the same as multiplying with variables with one exception, we will want to simplify our final answer so there are no exponents on i.

Dividing with complex numbers also has one thing we need to be careful of. If i is √−1, and it is in the denominator of a fraction, then we have a radical in the denominator! This means we will want to rationalize our denominator so there are no i’s. This is done the same way we rationalized denominators with square roots.

Using i we can simplify radicals with negatives under the root. We will use the product rule and simplify the negative as a factor of negative one.

By using i = √− 1 we will be able to simplify and solve problems that we could not simplify and solve before. This will be explored in more detail in a later sec- tion.

## Quadratics

### Quadratics - Solving with Radicals

Objective: Solve equations with radicals and check for extraneous solu- tions.
Here we look at equations that have roots in the problem. As you might expect, to clear a root we can raise both sides to an exponent. So to clear a square root we can rise both sides to the second power. To clear a cubed root we can raise both sides to a third power. There is one catch to solving a problem with roots in it, sometimes we end up with solutions that do not actually work in the equation. This will only happen if the index on the root is even, and it will not happen all the time. So for these problems it will be required that we check our answer in the original problem. If a value does not work it is called an extraneous solution and not included in the final solution.

When solving a radical problem with an even index: check answers!

When there is more than one square root in the problem, after isolating one root and squaring both sides we may still have a root remaining in the problem. In this case we will again isolate the term with the second root and square both sides. When isolating, we will isolate the term with the square root. This means the square root can be multiplied by a number after isolating.

### Quadratics - Solving with Exponents

Objective: Solve equations with exponents using the odd root property and the even root property.

Another type of equation we can solve is one with exponents. As you might expect we can clear exponents by using roots. This is done with very few unex- pected results when the exponent is odd. We solve these problems very straight forward using the odd root property

Odd Root Property:if a^n=b,thena=√n b when n is odd

However, when the exponent is even we will have two results from taking an even root of both sides. One will be positive and one will be negative. This is because both 3^2 =9 and (−3)^2 =9. so when solving x^2 =9 we will have two solutions, one positive and one negative: x = 3 and − 3

Even  RootProperty:if a^n=b,then a=±√n b when n iseven

### Quadratics - Complete the Square

Objective: Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
When solving quadratic equations in the past we have used factoring to solve for our variable.

However, the problem with factoring is all equations cannot be factored. Consider the following equation: x2 − 2x − 7 = 0. The equation cannot be factored, however there are two solutions to this equation, 1 + 2√2 and 1 − 2√2. To find these two solutions we will use a method known as completing the square. When completing the square we will change the quadratic into a perfect square which can easily be solved with the square root property.

The following five steps describe the process used to complete the square
1. Separate constant term from variables
2. Divide each term by a
3. Find value to complete the square: 􏰅 (1/2 · b)^􏰆2
4. Add to both sides of equation
5. Factor

### Quadratics - Quadratic Formula

Objective: Solve quadratic equations by using the quadratic formula.
The general from of a quadratic is ax2 + bx + c = 0. We will now solve this for- mula for x by completing the square

Quadratic Formula:if ax2 +bx+c=0 then x= (−b±􏰏√(b2 −4ac)) / 2a

World View Note: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave the first explicit formula for solving quadratics in 628. However, at that time mathematics was not done with variables and symbols, so the formula he gave was, “To the absolute number multiplied by four times the square, add the square of the middle term; the square root of the same, less the middle term, being divided by twice the square is the value.”

We have covered three different methods to use to solve a quadratic: factoring, complete the square, and the quadratic formula. It is important to be familiar with all three as each has its advantage to solving quadratics. The following table walks through a suggested process to decide which method would be best to use for solving a problem.

1. If it can easily factor, solve by factoring
2. If a = 1 and b is even, complete the square
3. Otherwise, solve by the quadratic formula

The above table is mearly a suggestion for deciding how to solve a quadtratic. Remember completing the square and quadratic formula will always work to solve any quadratic. Factoring only woks if the equation can be factored.

Quadratics - Build Quadratics From Roots

Objective: Find a quadratic equation that has given roots using reverse factoring and reverse completing the square.
Up to this point we have found the solutions to quadratics by a method such as factoring or completing the square. Here we will take our solutions and work backwards to find what quadratic goes with the solutions.

We will start with rational solutions. If we have rational solutions we can use fac- toring in reverse, we will set each solution equal to x and then make the equation equal to zero by adding or subtracting. Once we have done this our expressions will become the factors of the quadratic.

The solutions are 4 and − 2 Set each solution equal to x
x=4 or x=−2 Make each equation equal zero
−4−4 +2 +2 Subtract 4 from first, add 2 to second
x−4=0 or x+2=0 These expressions are the factors
(x−4)(x+2)=0 FOIL
x2+2x−4x−8 Combine like terms
x2−2x−8=0 Our Solution

If one or both of the solutions are fractions we will clear the fractions by multi- plying by the denominators.

If the solutions have radicals (or complex numbers) then we cannot use reverse factoring. In these cases we will use reverse completing the square. When there are radicals the solutions will always come in pairs, one with a plus, one with a minus, that can be combined into “one” solution using ± . We will then set this solution equal to x and square both sides. This will clear the radical from our problem.

### Quadratics - Quadratic in Form

Objective: Solve equations that are quadratic in form by substitution to create a quadratic equation.
We have seen three different ways to solve quadratics: factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. A quadratic is any equation of the form 0 = ax2 + bx + c, however, we can use the skills learned to solve quadratics to solve problems with higher (or sometimes lower) powers if the equation is in what is called quadratic form.

Quadratic Form:0=ax^m+bx^n+c where m=2n

An equation is in quadratic form if one of the exponents on a variable is double the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equation. If this is the case we can create a new variable, set it equal to the variable with smallest expo- nent. When we substitute this into the equation we will have a quadratic equa- tion we can solve.

World View Note: Arab mathematicians around the year 1000 were the first to use this method!

When we have higher powers of our variable, we could end up with many more solutions.

### Quadratics - Rectangles

Objective: Solve applications of quadratic equations using rectangles.
An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will first draw a picture to represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.

Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “frame problem”. The idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a photograph, is centered inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases it will be important to rememember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectangle.

### Quadratics - Teamwork

Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational equation to model the problem.
If it takes one person 4 hours to paint a room and another person 12 hours to paint the same room, working together they could paint the room even quicker, it turns out they would paint the room in 3 hours together. This can be reasoned by the following logic, if the first person paints the room in 4 hours, she paints 1/4 of the room each hour. If the second person takes 12 hours to paint the room, he paints 1/12 of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint 1/4 + 1/12 of the room. Using a common denominator of 12 gives: 3/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 = 1. This means veach hour, working together they complete 1/3 of the room. If 1/3 is completed each hour, it follows that it will take 3 hours to complete the entire room.

This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the first person does a job in A, a second person does a job in B, and together they can do a job in T (total). We can use the team work equation.

Teamwork Equation: 1/A + 1/B = 1/T

Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than thinking of the first fraction as 1/A , it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of A’s time.

World View Note: When the Egyptians, who were the first to work with frac- tions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numerator of one). They only used these type of fractions for about 2000 years! Some believe that this cumber- some style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradition, others believe the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fractions that has been completely lost in history.

### Quadratics - Simultaneous Products

Objective: Solve simultaneous product equations using substitution to create a rational equation.
When solving a system of equations where the variables are multiplied together we can use the same idea of substitution that we used with linear equations. When we do so we may end up with a quadratic equation to solve. When we used substitution we solved for a variable and substitute this expression into the other equation. If we have two products we will choose a variable to solve for first and divide both sides of the equations by that variable or the factor containing the variable. This will create a situation where substitution can easily be done.

These simultaneous product equations will also solve by the exact same pattern. We pick a variable to solve for, divide each side by that variable, or factor con- taining the variable. This will allow us to use substitution to create a rational expression we can use to solve. Quite often these problems will have two solu- tions.

The processes used here will be used as we solve applications of quadratics including distance problems and revenue problems. These will be covered in another section.

World View Note: William Horner, a British mathematician from the late 18th century/early 19th century is credited with a method for solving simultaneous equations, however, Chinese mathematician Chu Shih-chieh in 1303 solved these equations with exponents as high as 14!

### Quadratics - Revenue and Distance

Objective: Solve revenue and distance applications of quadratic equa- tions.
A common application of quadratics comes from revenue and distance problems. Both are set up almost identical to each other so they are both included together. Once they are set up, we will solve them in exactly the same way we solved the simultaneous product equations.

Revenue problems are problems where a person buys a certain number of items for a certain price per item. If we multiply the number of items by the price per item we will get the total paid.

The price column will be used for the individual prices, the total column is used for the total paid, which is calculated by multiplying the number by the price. Once we have the table filled out we will have our equations which we can solve.

The above examples were solved by the quadratic formula and completing the square. For either of these we could have used either method or even factoring. Remember we have several options for solving quadratics. Use the one that seems easiest for the problem.

Distance problems work with the same ideas that the revenue problems work. The only difference is the variables are r and t (for rate and time), instead of n and p (for number and price). We already know that distance is calculated by multiplying rate by time.

Another type of simultaneous product distance problem is where a boat is trav- eling in a river with the current or against the current (or an airplane flying with the wind or against the wind). If a boat is traveling downstream, the current will push it or increase the rate by the speed of the current. If a boat is traveling upstream, the current will pull against it or decrease the rate by the speed of the current.

### Quadratics - Graphs of Quadratics

Objective: Graph quadratic equations using the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercept.
Just as we drew pictures of the solutions for lines or linear equations, we can draw a picture of solution to quadratics as well.

When we have x2 in our equations, the graph will no longer be a straight line. Quadratics have a graph that looks like a U shape that is called a parabola.
World View Note: The first major female mathematician was Hypatia of Egypt who was born around 370 AD. She studied conic sections. The parabola is one type of conic section.

The above method to graph a parabola works for any equation, however, it can be very tedious to find all the correct points to get the correct bend and shape. For this reason we identify several key points on a graph and in the equation to help us graph parabolas more efficiently. These key points are described below.

Point A: y-intercept: Where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis.
Points B and C: x-intercepts: Where the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis
Point D: Vertex: The point where the graph curves and changes directions.

We will use the following method to find each of the points on our parabola.
To graph the equation y = ax2 + bx + c, find the following points
1. y-intercept: Found by making x = 0, this simplifies down to y = c
2. x-intercepts: Found by making y = 0, this means solving 0 = a x2 + b x + c
3. Vertex: Let x = − b/2a to find x. Then plug this value into the equation to find
After finding these points we can connect the dots with a smooth curve to find our graph!

If the a in y=ax2 +bx+c is a negative value, the parabola will end up being an upside-down U. The process to graph it is identical, we just need to be very careful of how our signs operate. Remember, if a is negative, then ax2 will also be negative because we only square the x, not the a.

It is important to remember the graph of all quadratics is a parabola with the same U shape (they could be upside-down). If you plot your points and we cannot connect them in the correct U shape then one of your points must be wrong. Go back and check your work to be sure they are correct!

Just as all quadratics (equation with y = x2) all have the same U-shape to them and all linear equations (equations such as y = x) have the same line shape when graphed, different equations have different shapes to them.

## Functions

### Functions - Function Notation

Objective: Idenfity functions and use correct notation to evaluate func- tions at numerical and variable values.
There are many different types of equations that we can work with in algebra. An equation gives the relationship between variables and numbers.

There is a speical classification of relationships known as functions. Functions have at most one output for any input. Generally x is the variable that we plug into an equation and evaluate to find y. For this reason x is considered an input variable and y is considered an output variable. This means the definition of a function, in terms of equations in x and y could be said, for any x value there is at most one y value that corresponds with it.

A great way to visualize this definition is to look at the graphs of a few relation- ships. Because x values are vertical lines we will draw a vertical line through the graph. If the vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that means we have too many possible y values. If the graph crosses the graph only once, then we say the relationship is a function.

Once we know we have a function, often we will change the notation used to emphasis the fact that it is a function. Instead of writing y = , we will use func- tion notation which can be written f(x)=. We read this notation “f of x”. So for the above example that was a function, instead of writing y = 3x2 − 5, we could have written f (x) = 3x2 − 5. It is important to point out that f (x) does not mean f times x, it is mearly a notation that names the function with the first letter (function f) and then in parenthesis we are given information about what vari- ables are in the function (variable x). The first letter can be anything we want it to be, often you will see g(x) (read g of x).

Once we know a relationship is a function, we may be interested in what values can be put into the equations. The values that are put into an equation (generally the x values) are called the domain. When finding the domain, often it is easier to consider what cannot happen in a given function, then exclude those values.

### Functions - Operations on Functions

Objective: Combine functions using sum, difference, product, quotient and composition of functions.
Several functions can work together in one larger function. There are 5 common operations that can be performed on functions. The four basic operations on func- tions are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The notation for these functions is as follows.
Addition (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)
Subtraction (f − g)(x) = f (x) − g(x)
Multiplication (f · g)(x) = f (x)g(x)
Division (􏰇f/g)􏰈(x)=f(x)/g(x)

When we do one of these four basic operations we can simply evaluate the two functions at the value and then do the operation with both solutions

The fifth operation of functions is called composition of functions. A composition of functions is a function inside of a function. The notation used for composition of functions is:
(f ◦ g)(x) = f(g(x))

To calculate a composition of function we will evaluate the inner function and substitute the answer into the outer function.

### Functions - Inverse Functions

Objective: Identify and find inverse functions.
When a value goes into a function it is called the input. The result that we get when we evaluate the function is called the output. When working with functions sometimes we will know the output and be interested in what input gave us the output. To find this we use an inverse function. As the name suggests an inverse function undoes whatever the function did. If a function is named f(x), the inverse function will be named f−1(x) (read “f inverse of x”). The negative one is not an exponent, but mearly a symbol to let us know that this function is the inverse of f.

For example, if f (x) = x + 5, we could deduce that the inverse function would be f−1(x)=x−5. If we had an input of 3, we could calculate f(3)=(3)+5=8. Our output is 8. If we plug this output into the inverse function we get f −1(8) = (8) − 5 = 3, which is the original input.

Often the functions are much more involved than those described above. It may be difficult to determine just by looking at the functions if they are inverses. In order to test if two functions, f(x) and g(x) are inverses we will calculate the composition of the two functions at x. If f changes the variable x in some way, then g undoes whatever f did, then we will be back at x again for our final solu- tion. In otherwords, if we simplify (f ◦ g)(x) the solution will be x. If it is any- thing but x the functions are not inverses.

While the composition is useful to show two functions are inverses, a more common problem is to find the inverse of a function. If we think of x as our input and y as our output from a function, then the inverse will take y as an input and give x as the output. This means if we switch x and y in our function we will find the inverse! This process is called the switch and solve strategy.
Switch and solve strategy to find an inverse:
1. Replace f(x) with y
2. Switch x and y’s
3. Solve for y
4. Replace y with f−1(x)

In this lesson we looked at two different things, first showing functions are inverses by calculating the composition, and second finding an inverse when we only have one function. Be careful not to get them backwards. When we already have two functions and are asked to show they are inverses, we do not want to use the switch and solve strategy, what we want to do is calculate the inverse. There may be several ways to represent the same function so the switch and solve strategy may not look the way we expect and can lead us to conclude two func- tions are not inverses when they are in fact inverses.

### Functions - Exponential Functions

Objective: Solve exponential equations by finding a common base.
As our study of algebra gets more advanced we begin to study more involved functions. One pair of inverse functions we will look at are exponential functions and logarithmic functions. Here we will look at exponential functions and then we will consider logarithmic functions in another lesson. Exponential functions are functions where the variable is in the exponent such as f(x)=ax. (It is important not to confuse exponential functions with polynomial functions where the variable is in the base such as f(x)=x2).

Solving exponetial equations cannot be done using the skill set we have seen in the past. For example, if 3x = 9, we cannot take the x − root of 9 because we do not know what the index is and this doesn’t get us any closer to finding x. How- ever, we may notice that 9 is 32. We can then conclude that if 3x = 32 then x = 2. This is the process we will use to solve exponential functions. If we can re-write a problem so the bases match, then the exponents must also match.

It may take a bit of practice to get use to knowing which base to use, but as we practice we will get much quicker at knowing which base to use. As we do so, we will use our exponent properties to help us simplify. Again, below are the proper- ties we used to simplify.
(a^x)^y =a^(xy) and 1/a^n =a^(−n) and a^x * a^y =a^(x+y)

All the problems we have solved here
However, not all problems can be written with a common base, for example, 2 = 10x, we cannot write this problem with a common base. To solve problems like this we will need to use the inverse of an exponential function. The inverse is called a logarithmic function, which we will discuss in another secion.

### Functions - Logarithmic Functions

Objective: Convert between logarithms and exponents and use that relationship to solve basic logarithmic equations.
The inverse of an exponential function is a new function known as a logarithm.
Lograithms are studied in detail in advanced algebra, here we will take an introductory look at how logarithms works. When working with radicals we found that there were two ways to write radicals. The expression m√a^n could be written as a^(n/m). Each form has its advantages, thus we need to be comfortable using both the radical form and the rational exponent form. Similarly an exponent can be written in two forms, each with its own advantages. The first form we are very familiar with, bx = a, where b is the base, a can be thought of as our answer, and x is the exponent. The second way to write this is with a logarithm, logba = x. The word “log” tells us that we are in this new form. The variables all still mean the same thing. b is still the base, a can still be thought of as our answer.
Using this idea the problem 52 = 25 could also be written as log525 = 2. Both mean the same thing, both are still the same exponent problem, but just as roots can be written in radical form or rational exponent form, both our forms have their own advantages. The most important thing to be comfortable doing with logarithms and exponents is to be able to switch back and forth between the two forms.

### Functions - Compound Interest

Objective: Calculate final account balances using the formulas for com- pound and continuous interest.
An application of exponential functions is compound interest. When money is invested in an account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the balance. This money added to the balance is called interest. Once that interest is added to the balance, it will earn more interest during the next compounding period. This idea of earning interest on interest is called compound interest. For example, if you invest S100 at 10% interest compounded annually, after one year you will earn S10 in interest, giving you a new balance of S110. The next year you will earn another 10% or S11, giving you a new balance of S121. The third year you will earn another 10% or S12.10, giving you a new balance of S133.10. This pattern will continue each year until you close the account.

There are several ways interest can be paid. The first way, as described above, is compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But interest can be compounded more often. Some common compounds include com- pounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four times per year, such as quarterly taxes), monthly (12 times per year, such as a savings account), weekly (52 times per year), or even daily (365 times per year, such as some student loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways we can calculate the balance after any amount of time using the following formula:

Compound Interest Formula: A = P(􏰅1 + n/r)^(􏰆nt)
A = Final Amount
P = Principle (starting balance)
r = Interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of compounds per year
t = time (in years)

As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compounded, the higher the final balance will be. The reason is, because we are calculating compound interest or interest on interest. So once interest is paid into the account it will start earning interest for the next compound and thus giving a higher final balance. The next question one might consider is what is the maximum number of com- pounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interest compounded an infinite number of times a year. This is when the interest is compounded continu- ously. When we see the word “continuously” we will know that we cannot use the first formula. Instead we will use the following formula:

Interest Compounded Continuously: A = Pe^(rt)
A = Final Amount
P = Principle (starting balance)
e = a constant approximately 2.71828183....
r = Interest rate (written as a decimal)
t = time (years)

The variable e is a constant similar in idea to pi (π) in that it goes on forever without repeat or pattern, but just as pi (π) naturally occurs in several geometry applications, so does e appear in many exponential applications, continuous interest being one of them. If you have a scientific calculator you probably have an e button (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit ln) that will be useful in calculating interest compounded continuously.

World View Note: e first appeared in 1618 in Scottish mathematician’s Napier’s work on logarithms. However it was Euler in Switzerland who used the letter e first to represent this value. Some say he used e because his name begins with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with e. Others say it is because Euler’s work already had the letter a in use, so e would be the next value. What- ever the reason, ever since he used it in 1731, e became the natural base.

### Functions - Trigonometric Functions

Objective: Solve for a missing side of a right triangle using trigono- metric ratios.
There are six special functions that describe the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the angles of the triangle. We will discuss three of the func- tions here. The three functions are called the sine, cosine, and tangent (the three others are cosecant, secant, and cotangent, but we will not need to use them here).

To the right is a picture of a right tri- angle. Based on which angle we are interested in on a given problem we will name the three sides in relation- ship to that angle. In the picture, angle A is the angle we will use to name the other sides. The longest side, the side opposite the right angle is always called the hypotenouse. The side across from the angle A is called the opposite side.

The third side, the side between our angle and the right angle is called the adja- cent side. It is important to remember that the opposite and adjacent sides are named in relationship to the angle A or the angle we are using in a problem. If the angle had been the top angle, the opposite and adjacent sides would have been switched.
The three trigonometric funtions are functions taken of angles. When an angle goes into the function, the output is a ratio of two of the triangle sides. The ratios are as describe below:

sinθ = opposite/hypotenuse
cosθ = adjacent/hypotenuse
tanθ = opposite/adjacent


The “weird” variable θ is a greek letter, pronounced “theta” and is close in idea to our letter “t”. Often working with triangles, the angles are repesented with Greek letters, in honor of the Ancient Greeks who developed much of Geometry. Some students remember the three ratios by remembering the word “SOH CAH TOA” where each letter is the first word of: “Sine: Opposite over Hypotenuse; Cosine: Adjacent over Hypotenuse; and Tangent: Opposite over Adjacent.” Knowing how to use each of these relationships is fundamental to solving problems using trigonometry.

### Functions - Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Ob jective: Solve for missing angles of a right triangle using inverse trigonometry.
We used a special function, one of the trig functions, to take an angle of a triangle and find the side length. Here we will do the opposite, take the side lengths and find the angle. Because this is the opposite operation, we will use the inverse function of each of the trig ratios we saw before. The notation we will use for the inverse trig functions will be similar to the inverse notation we used with func- tions.

Using a combination of trig functions and inverse trig functions, if we are given two parts of a right triangle (two sides or a side and an angle), we can find all the other sides and angles of the triangle. This is called solving a triangle.
When we are solving a triangle, we can use trig ratios to solve for all the missing parts of it, but there are some properties from geometry that may be helpful along the way.
The angles of a triangle always add up to 180◦, because we have a right triangle, 90◦ are used up in the right angle, that means there are another 90◦ left in the two acute angles. In other words, the smaller two angles will always add to 90, if we know one angle, we can quickly find the other by subtracting from 90.
Another trick is on the sides of the angles. If we know two sides of the right tri- angle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the third side. The Pythagorean Theorem states that if c is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and a and b are the other two sides (legs), then we can use the following formula, a2 + b2 = c2 to find a missing side.
Often when solving triangles we use trigonometry to find one part, then use the angle sum and/or the Pythagorean Theorem to find the other two parts.
